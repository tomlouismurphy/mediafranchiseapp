### User Stories:
1. As Users, we want to be able to log into the database with our own username and password.
2. As Admins, we want to be able to generate a list of links to a show page that will present the respective data for one of the 440 Disney movies in our Mongo database.
3. As Admins, we want our show pages to show all of our intended movie model data and be able to generate/hide User input sections near the bottom through a button toolbar.
4. As Users, we want to be able to post comments on each respective movie show page and be able to see what number of comment it was, our username and the content of the comment.
5. As Users, we want to be able to add/edit new data that's related to each respective movie onto its show page.
6. As Admins, we want to be able to save the Users' inputs into the corresponding movie's entry in the database so that the archived data can be pulled up on the page by anyone.
7. As Users, we want to be able to look up an archive of what movie entries were changed by our specific profile.
8. As Admins, we want to design our pages so that they are both appealing to look at, are easy to navigate/understand, and are not overwhelming in the amount of data that is being presented.
9. As Admins, we want to be able to encrypt each user's password so that no one but the password-holder may access the username.
10. As Admins, we want our app to be deployed by Heroku so that it may be accessible to the general public.

### Potential Updates:
- Add ability for users to post links to outside articles/artwork/fan material that will be added based on tags to actor/character/movie pages
- Add crossfunctionality between actors and characters schemae so that you can access an actor page from a character they have played and vice versa
