## Project 2: Disney Vault Database (DVDb)

### Directions:
The Disney Vault Database (DVDb) is an information-heavy app that serves two major purposes:

1. DVDb acts as an information resource for nearly every Disney-produced movie since the company’s conception and is constantly updating over time thanks to the inputs from our Admins and our dedicated user base. Information such as the movie’s release date, characters, actors/actresses and production crew can be found on each movie’s respective page and, should there be any information that’s missing, new info can be added into the movie’s entry in the database.

2. DVDb acts as a platform for Disney fans and friends alike to communicate their interest in their favorite movies, as well as keep track of what Disney productions they may or may not have seen yet. This helps build a community among our users and can help further build dedication towards the continuous updating/maintenence of our site’s movie database.

### User Stories:
1. As Users, we want to be able to log into the database with our own username and password.
2. As Admins, we want to be able to generate a list of links to a show page that will present the respective data for one of the 440 Disney movies in our Mongo database.
3. As Admins, we want our show pages to show all of our intended movie model data and be able to generate/hide User input sections near the bottom through a button toolbar.
4. As Users, we want to be able to post comments on each respective movie show page and be able to see what number of comment it was, our username and the content of the comment.
5. As Users, we want to be able to add/edit new data that's related to each respective movie onto its show page.
6. As Admins, we want to be able to save the Users' inputs into the corresponding movie's entry in the database so that the archived data can be pulled up on the page by anyone.
7. As Users, we want to be able to look up an archive of what movie entries were changed by our specific profile.
8. As Admins, we want to design our pages so that they are both appealing to look at, are easy to navigate/understand, and are not overwhelming in the amount of data that is being presented.
9. As Admins, we want to be able to encrypt each user's password so that no one but the password-holder may access the username.
10. As Admins, we want our app to be deployed by Heroku so that it may be accessible to the general public.

### Potential Updates:
- Add ability for users to post links to outside articles/artwork/fan material that will be added based on tags to actor/character/movie pages
- Add crossfunctionality between actors and characters schemae so that you can access an actor page from a character they have played and vice versa
- We would like to give the user the functionality to edit their profile page even further. For instance, the user could have the ability to change their background color, add more sections to their information, post their own images on their page, and create connections/friend requests to other users.
- If given more time, we would’ve liked to further design our app to both differentiate it from other potential apps with similiar purposes and to give it it’s own branding that would make it memorable to the public. Potential avenues to take include creating our own logo for the site and have it be prominent on title pages, as well as on the bottom nav bar. Another avenue would be to attach thumbnail pictures to movies and characters links outside of their show pages (as well as on the side info column in the show page when appropriate) so as to better recognize who or what each name/term is referring to.
